# \<Full Repository Name\>

## Introduction
Add a brief introduction that describes the repository and any associated work i.e. papers, other datasets.

<Add a .gif demonstrating a part of the work.>

## Quick Start
This repository is only compatible with [PYNQ images v2.6 and greater](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ/releases) for the [ZCU111](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu111.html) and the [RFSoC2x2]().

Connect to the board with **Jupyter Lab** in a browser (not Jupyter Notebook) by using a web browser `https://<IP address>:9090/lab`.

Open a terminal in Jupyter Lab and run the following command:
```sh
pip3 install git+https://github.com/strath-sdr/RFSoC-PYNQ-Template
```

The notebook should now be available in the `rfstrath` folder in your Jupyter Workspace.
It is important that you use the Chrome web browser if possible as rendering performance is important.
